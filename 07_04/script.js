/**
 * Challenge: Build and modify an array
 Time for another challenge. Here I want you to build and modify an array. 
 Let me break down the specifics. I want you to create an array with several items. 
 The easiest thing you can do is just look around on your desk or wherever you are 
 and just add some different items, cards, pen, book whatever you want. 
 Just make an array of like five or seven or eight items. 
 Then I want you to use different methods to do different things to the array. 
 So I want you to remove the last item, to move the last item to the first position, to sort the items alphabetically, 
 to find a specific item in the array, and to remove an item with specific content from the array. 
 So for example, if you have an item called notebook, I want you to go into the array find that item and remove it. 
 Now, remember here, when you are working with arrays and methods, you can nest methods inside other methods. 
 Now here's the key. You can do this either by explicitly creating variables and then putting the array into the 
 variables and then outputting them later. Or you can nest different methods inside other methods. 
 If you go to the MDN web docs and look at the examples you'll see that some of the examples involve using multiple methods at 
 the same time or referring internally to different methods. So try out this challenge and see how you can get the 
 array to behave the way you want to. The main purpose of this challenge is to get you to use the MDN web docs to 
 find examples and solutions. So please go to the MDN web docs, look up array methods and all the answers you need to solve. 
 This challenge can be found right there. Take 10 minutes to solve this challenge. Then come back and watch the next movie to see my solution.
