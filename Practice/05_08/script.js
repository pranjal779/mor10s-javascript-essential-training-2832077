 * Find an element and and add two different classes
 * Remove only one the new classes
 * Add a new attribute to an element

/**
 * Being able to quickly access, modify, add and remove classes, attributes and inline styles from any element in the DOM,
 * is a bit like having a bag of tools on hand to solve pretty much any problem. Need to indicate a state change of an element?
 * Add or remove a class. Need to pass data from one element to the other? Add a data attribute.
 * Need to change the appearance of a specific element for some reason? Add an inline style.
 * In the previous practice assignment, you familiarized yourself with accessing DOM elements using the query selector and query selector all methods.
 * Now I want you to take this one step further by actively modifying the elements
 * you've targeted by adding or removing classes, attributes, and inline styles. Here's some examples of what you can do.
 * Find an element and add two different classes then remove only one of those new classes. Add a new attribute to an element.
 * This can be a standard attribute like source or alt if that's appropriate for that element or it can be a data attribute passing
 * literally any data you want. By the way data attributes follow the naming convention data dash and then the name of the attribute.
 * Request the value of the attribute you added. Change the value of that attribute you added. Add some inline CSS to an element by
 * specifying the style property and setting its value. And finally query the style of property of an element in the console to
 * get a list of all the style properties available to you.
