Functions are an integral part of JavaScript. 
And as you've seen, there are several different ways of declaring a function. 
In this practice assignment, I want you to really familiarize yourself with the basics of how to declare 
functions so you get used to writing them, calling them, and making them do stuff. Function expressions, 
function declarations, and arrow functions, all have their uses, and being comfortable with declaring all 
of them and recognizing them is hugely important to your learning. So here's what I want you to do. 
Create a basic function declaration. You'll remember, this is where we say function followed by the name of the function. 
In the body of the function declaration, do something to an element in the DOM. For this, you can use any of the techniques 
we've covered earlier, finding an element using QuerySelector, adding a class, whatever you like. 
Call this function declaration so the action actually takes place and check it in the browser. 
Then next, create a basic function expression. That's when you define a variable and then place an anonymous function inside. 
Do the same as above, find an elements, make a change to it, call the function, make sure it works, and finally, 
create an arrow function, make it do something and call it. This practice assignment is all about making functions. 
What the function does is less important at this point. I want you to get familiar with getting the different types of functions to work.
